# 3.3 Stack and Function

```nasm
1.  [bits 16]                                       ; Set 16-bit mode for the program

2.  StartingPoint equ 0x7c00                        ; Define the starting point of the bootloader at memory address 0x7c00
3.  [org StartingPoint]                             ; Set the origin for the program, meaning the code will start at memory address 0x7c00
4.  jmp _start                                      ; Jump to the _start label to begin execution of the bootloader
```
```nasm
5.  msg: db "Hello, World!", 0                      ; Define a null-terminated string "Hello, World!" that will be printed to the screen
```
