# Chapter 3.3: Stack and Function

The stack in the 8086 processor is a hardware-level data structure that operates
in LIFO (Last In First Out) mode, similar to a bullet magazine.
The operation of the stack involves two key registers: `SS` (Stack Segment) and
`SP` (Stack Pointer) used by `push` and `pop` operations.

The Stack Pointer (`SP`) is designed with memory reservation checks in mind.
It points to the higher end of the reserved stack memory and writes data from top
to bottom. This means that `SP` decreases with each `push` operation and increases
with each `pop` operation. Understanding this allows us to access and discard stack
elements without using the `push` and `pop` commands directly.

Same process as before:
```nasm
1.  [bits 16]                                       ; Set 16-bit mode for the program
2.  StartingPoint equ 0x7c00                        ; Define the starting point of the bootloader at memory address 0x7c00
3.  [org StartingPoint]                             ; Set the origin for the program, meaning the code will start at memory address 0x7c00
4.  jmp _start                                      ; Jump to the _start label to begin execution of the bootloader
```

Define the message to be printed. For this, we use an ASCII string terminated with a '0' at the end.
```nasm
5.  msg: db "Hello, World!", 0                      ; Define a null-terminated string "Hello, World!" that will be printed to the screen
```
> **Note:** The colon ':' is not necessary in this case, meaning, `msg db "Hello, World!", 0` is also correct.

We define a function that involves two primary operations: `call` and `ret`.
These operations are straightforward, but their relationship with the stack might
not be immediately obvious. Here's how it works:

The `call` instruction is effectively split into two steps:
```nasm
    ; call _func
    push _ret   ; Save the return address on the stack
    jmp _func   ; Jump to the function
    _ret:       ; Label for the return address
```

The `ret` instruction performs the reverse of the `call` operation:
```nasm
    ; ret
    pop ax      ; Pop the return address off the stack into AX
    jmp ax      ; Jump to the address stored in AX
```

However, the above description is a simplification and not entirely accurate.
In reality, the `ret` operation does not affect any registers other than
`SP` (Stack Pointer). Additionally, the `jmp` instruction does not directly
accept `ax`, or any register containing an indirect address, as a simple operand.

```nasm
6.  _print:
7.      pusha                                       ; Push all general-purpose registers (AX, BX, CX, DX, SI, DI, BP, SP) onto the stack to preserve their values
```
> **Note:** `pusha` is an operation introduced with the Intel 80186 that pushes
> all general-purpose registers onto the stack, including `SS` (Stack Segment) and `SP`
> (Stack Pointer). This is done to preserve the state of the CPU before making any
> changes within a function. By pushing these values, we ensure that the original
> segment configurations remain unaltered if the segment registers are modified during
> the function's execution.

`pusha` pushes the registers in the following order:

| Offset (relative to initial SP) | Register Pushed |
|---------------------------------|-----------------|
| SP - 16                         | DI              |
| SP - 14                         | SI              |
| SP - 12                         | BP              |
| SP - 10                         | Original SP     |
| SP - 08                         | BX              |
| SP - 06                         | DX              |
| SP - 04                         | CX              |
| SP - 02                         | AX              |

Now, we extract the parameter:
```nasm
8.      ; Setup source [DS:SI] (source segment and index for loading data)
9.      ; Setup data segment
10.     mov ax, 0x07C0                              ; Load the value 0x07C0 into AX, which is the segment address of the bootloader
11.     mov ds, ax                                  ; Set the data segment (DS) to the bootloader's segment
12.     mov bp, sp                                  ; Set BP (base pointer) to point to the current stack pointer (SP), which holds the string base address
13.     mov ax, [ss:bp + 18]                        ; Load the address from the stack at [SS:BP+18], which is the parameter provided before calling, into AX
```
> **Note:** In NASM, `SS:SP` is not allowed as a valid memory operand in certain
> contexts due to assembler syntax restrictions.
> As a workaround, the `BP` (Base Pointer) register is often used instead.

```nasm
14.     sub ax, StartingPoint                       ; Subtract the StartingPoint address from the value in AX to get the relative position of the message
15.     mov si, ax                                  ; Store the result into SI, which now holds the relative position of the message for the data segment to work

16.     ; Setup destination [ES:DI] (destination segment and index for video memory)
17.     mov ax, 0xB800                              ; Load 0xB800 into AX, which is the segment address of video memory in text mode
18.     mov es, ax                                  ; Set the extra segment (ES) to the video memory segment
19.     xor di, di                                  ; Clear DI to 0, DI will be used as the destination index in video memory

20.     _loop:
21.     .begin:
22.         mov byte al, [ds:si]                    ; Load the byte at [DS:SI] into AL (this is a character from the "Hello, World!" string)
23.         cmp al, 0                               ; Compare AL with 0 (null terminator)
24.         je .end                                 ; If AL is 0 (null terminator), jump to the .end label to finish the printing process

25.         ; Print character:
26.         mov byte [es:di], al                    ; Store the character in AL at the video memory address [ES:DI]
27.         inc di                                  ; Increment DI to move to the next position in video memory
28.         mov byte [es:di], 0x97                  ; Store 0x97 (attribute byte, color) at [ES:DI] for the character
29.         inc di                                  ; Increment DI to point to the next space for the next character

30.         inc si                                  ; Increment SI to point to the next character in the source string
31.         jmp .begin                              ; Jump back to .begin to process the next character
32.     .end:
```

We restore the CPU state using `popa` before returning:
```nasm
33.     popa                                        ; Pop all general-purpose registers from the stack to restore their original values
34.     ret                                         ; Return to the caller (the return address will be popped from the stack)
```

```nasm
35. _start:
36.     ; Initialize segment registers for the bootloader to run properly
37.     mov ax, 0x9000                              ; Load 0x9000 into AX, which is the segment for the stack
38.     mov ss, ax                                  ; Set SS (stack segment) to the value in AX (0x9000)
39.     mov sp, 0xFFFF                              ; Set the stack pointer (SP) to 0xFFFF, which is at the top of DRAM

40.     push word msg                               ; Push the address of the msg string onto the stack
41.     call _print                                 ; Call the _print function to display the message on the screen

42. _end:
43.     hlt                                         ; Halt the processor (end of the program)
44.     jmp near _end                               ; If the processor is not halted, jump to _end to create an infinite loop

45. times 510-($-$$) db 0                           ; Fill the rest of the boot sector with zeros until it is 510 bytes in total
46. dw 0xAA55                                       ; Append the boot sector signature 0xAA55 to mark it as a valid bootable sector
```
