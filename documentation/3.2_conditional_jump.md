# Chapter 3.2: Conditional Jump

Here is an example of using a conditional jump to create a loop:

```nasm
1. [bits 16]                                            ; Set the program to run in 16-bit mode
2. 
3. StartingPoint equ 0x7c00                             ; Define the starting point of the bootloader at memory address 0x7c00
4. [org StartingPoint]                                  ; Set the origin of the program to 0x7c00, meaning the program code starts at this memory address
5. jmp _start                                           ; Jump to the _start label to begin the bootloader execution
6. 
7. _data:                                               ; Define a data section with two 16-bit words (1234 and 1235)
8.     dw 1234, 1235                                    ; Declare two data words 1234 and 1235
9.     .len:                                            ; Create a label called .len to calculate the length of the data
10.    dw ($ - _data) / 2                               ; Calculate the length of the data array in 16-bit units and store it in .len (number of elements)
11. 
12. _start:
13.     mov ax, 0x07C0                                  ; Load 0x07C0 into AX, the segment address for the bootloader
14.     mov ds, ax                                      ; Set the data segment (DS) to the bootloader segment
15. 
16.     mov cx, [ds:_data.len - StartingPoint]          ; Load the length of the _data array into CX by calculating the difference between the address of .len and the StartingPoint
17.                                                     ; The result in CX will be the number of 16-bit words in the data (2 words in this case)
18. 
19.     ; Loop body
20. _loop:
21.     .start:
22.         cmp cx, 0x00                                ; Compare the value in CX (the counter) with 0
23.         je .stop                                    ; If CX equals 0, jump to the .stop label to exit the loop
24. 
25.         dec cx                                      ; Decrement CX (reduce the counter by 1)
26.         jmp .start                                  ; Jump back to .start to continue the loop if CX is not 0
27. 
28.     .stop:
29.         jmp $                                       ; Jump to the current address, creating an infinite loop at this point to halt execution
30. 
31. times 510-($-$$) db 0                               ; Fill the remaining space in the boot sector with zeros, ensuring the total size is 510 bytes
32. dw 0xAA55                                           ; Append the boot sector signature (0xAA55) to indicate a valid boot sector
```

To execute a conditional jump in the 8086 processor, you must first compare two elements using `cmp`.
This comparison sets specific flags that determine the outcome of the jump.
The 8086 provides a variety of conditional jump instructions.
Choose the one that best matches your intended condition.

| **Instruction** | **Condition**                        | **Description**                               |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `JE` / `JZ`     | ZF = 1                               | Jump if Equal / Zero                          |
| `JNE` / `JNZ`   | ZF = 0                               | Jump if Not Equal / Not Zero                  |
| `JL` / `JNGE`   | SF ≠ OF                              | Jump if Less / Not Greater or Equal (signed)  |
| `JGE` / `JNL`   | SF = OF                              | Jump if Greater or Equal / Not Less (signed)  |

| `JB` / `JNAE`   | CF = 1                               | Jump if Below / Not Above or Equal (unsigned) |
| `JAE` / `JNB`   | CF = 0                               | Jump if Above or Equal / Not Below (unsigned) |
| `JA` / `JNBE`   | CF = 0 and ZF = 0                    | Jump if Above / Not Below or Equal (unsigned) |
| `JBE` / `JNA`   | CF = 1 or ZF = 1                     | Jump if Below or Equal / Not Above (unsigned) |
| `JC`            | CF = 1                               | Jump if Carry                                 |
| `JNC`           | CF = 0                               | Jump if No Carry                              |
| `JO`            | OF = 1                               | Jump if Overflow                              |
| `JNO`           | OF = 0                               | Jump if No Overflow                           |
| `JS`            | SF = 1                               | Jump if Sign (Negative)                       |
| `JNS`           | SF = 0                               | Jump if No Sign (Non-Negative)                |
| `JP` / `JPE`    | PF = 1                               | Jump if Parity Even                           |
| `JNP` / `JPO`   | PF = 0                               | Jump if Parity Odd                            |
| `JCXZ`          | CX = 0                               | Jump if CX Register is Zero                   |

In the above code, a label starting with `.` is considered a sub-label.
For example, `.len` following `_data` is not simply `.len`; it is interpreted as `_data.len`.
I think you can see where all these '.' in C/C++ structure/classes came from.
